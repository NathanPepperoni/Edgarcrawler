This program searches the Securities and Exchange Commissions website (https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)
and pulls all Regdex pdfs into a chosen directory. 

There are over 600,000 companies registered with the SEC, so expect a long (multi-day) runtime.


The program can resume a scan that was closed while in progress (even an abrupt shutdown), and can handle periodic brief network loss.
